# TRS-80 Model 1 Keyboard Adapter

This adapter enables you to connect a TEC (Japanese) Model 1 Keyboard to a Tandy Model 1 system, or connect a Tandy Model 1 Keyboard to a TEC Model 1 system.

**WARNING**: This project has not been confirmed to work yet. Use at your own risk.

## Why?

The Model 1 interface differs slightly between the TEC and Tandy versions of the keyboard. Because of this, connecting either keyboard to the other system is not possible without an adapter. This adapter allows you to connect either keyboard to either system. This is especially useful when connecting a [modern replica keyboard](https://github.com/RetroStack/TRS-80-Model-I-Keyboard-MX) to an original TEC Model 1, as only the Tandy interface is available.

## Project Details

### Latest Files

In the "Latest" folder, you'll find the most up-to-date design files, including:

- Gerber files suitable for popular online PCB manufacturers like [PCBWay](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_Adapter_Gerber_PCBWay.zip) and [JLCPCB](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_Adapter_Gerber_JLCPCB.zip). Most manufacturers should be fine with either.
- The [full schematics](/Latest/TRS80_Model_I_Keyboard_Adapter_Schematics.pdf) of the adapter.

### Implementation

This project has been implemented using KiCAD 9. The KiCAD project files are included in this repository.
